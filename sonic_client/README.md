# sonic_client

This is an electron-based desktop application for sonic. It is still in very early phase. The rendering part is done with ReactJS. This app has been tested on Ubuntu systems only.

> It is a part of the sonic application (superfast online judging system). This app is recommended for use in a controlled lab environment.

## Steps to run

-   Assuming you know / can learn about npm and nodejs.
-   Use `npm run electron:serve` to run the application in dev mode.
-   Use `npm run electron:build` to build a production ready app (TODO: electron-build seems to be better than electron-forge ?).
